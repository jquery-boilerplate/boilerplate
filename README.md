# jQuery Boilerplate

## A boilerplate for jump-starting jQuery plugins development.
So, you've tried your hand at writing jQuery plugins and you're comfortable putting together something that probably works. Awesome! Thing is, you think there might be better ways you could be writing them - you've seen them done a number of different ways in the wild, but aren't really sure what the differences between these patterns are or how to get started with them.

This project won't seek to provide a perfect solution to every possible pattern, but will attempt to cover a simple template for beginners and above. By using a basic defaults object, simple constructor for assigning the element to work with and extending options with defaults and a lightweight wrapper around the constructor to avoid issues with multiple instantiations.

## Build system (Grunt)

We use [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) to build jQuery Boilerplate. To run it, use `make build` in the root directory.

## Tests

For testing, we use qUnit. To run the tests, use `make test`.

## Have you created a plugin from our boilerplate?
Let us know [here](https://github.com/zenorocha/jquery-boilerplate/wiki/Sites)! Itâ€™s interesting to see what features others have come up with.
